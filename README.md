# Guess_Number
A simple game to guess the number

In this C program we can play a simple game for guessing a random number, generated by the program itself.

Despite working just as I expected, there's something that I want to change in a near future when I understand it better.<br>
Checking for invalid input on scanf. 

If you enter a char in this program it will consider as a integer value. 

Gonna try to fix it as soon as I can or feel free to contribute.
